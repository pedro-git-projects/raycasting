# Simple C Raycasting Engine

## Objective

Ray casting is a rendering technique that is capable of creating a three-dimensional perspective in a two-dimensional map. In this project the aim was to create a raycasting engine for rendering pseudo 3D graphics using trigonometric functions (another common techinque is the use of vectors) so as to deepen my understanding of computer graphics, mathematics and JavaScript. 

## Technology 

The main pieces of tech used in this project were: the c programming language. And the SDL library, which can be found here: https://www.libsdl.org/
A minimalistic fork from LodePNG called upng was also used for image decoding.

## Running the application

When cloning the repo, you will have access to a MAKEFILE. Make sure you have GCC installed and that this file is an executable then:

1. Run "Make" to compile

2. Run "Make run" to execute
